2 basic AI machine learning method:K-Nearest Neighbour and Decision tree learning method



To execute the code: 
First of all, use terminal to get into the source directory src
Then compile all java files with command: javac *.java

------------------------------------
Part 1 : K-Nearest Neighbour
------------------------------------
Make sure that we are in the src directory,
To run part 1 , enter the command with the format below:

java Main part1 Training_FilePath Test_FilePath

Example:
java Main part1 /Users/patrickzhang/Desktop/COMP307/COMP307A1/ass1_data/part1/wine-training /Users/patrickzhang/Desktop/COMP307/COMP307A1/ass1_data/part1/wine-test

Then the system will require a k value,  like :"Enter the 'K' Value: "

Now all we should do is to enter the K value
Then the system will run and print the result

------------------------------------
Part 2: Decision tree learning method
------------------------------------
Make sure that we are in the src directory,
To run part 2 , enter the command with the format below:

java Main part2 Training_FilePath Test_FilePath

Example:
java Main part2 /Users/patrickzhang/Desktop/COMP307/COMP307A1/ass1_data/part2//hepatitis-training /Users/patrickzhang/Desktop/COMP307/COMP307A1/ass1_data/part2/hepatitis-test

Then the system will run , print out the decision tree formed and accuracy

Then the system will ask if we want to apply 10-fold cross-validation, like: "Do you want to apply 10-fold cross-validation? (y/n)"
If we want to apply apply 10-fold cross-validation, we should enter y
then the system will require a directory path,
we should enter the directory path of the directory that contains the 10 test files provided
example:/Users/patrickzhang/Desktop/COMP307/COMP307A1/ass1_data/part2/
Then the 10-fold cross-validation will run and the result will be printed
